# StockPredictorView

The StockPredictorView is an Android app to request the direction of stock market indices.

## Procedure
The prediction of the market direction is calculated in a Databricks cluster and retrieved through its API. Currently, this only works with the S&P 500 dataset from 2001 to 2005 but the idea is that with access to real time stock quotes smartphone apps could help users buy or sell stocks more effectively.
